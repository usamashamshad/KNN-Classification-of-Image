# KNN-Classification-of-Image
I will be using the scripts KNN.ipyb. This scripts set up the data-set for the problem.
The data-set “data.mat” consists of 50 32x32 color images of actors in 10 classes (10 actors), with 5 images per class (5 images of each actor).
A Colour image is represented using a three-dimensional array. In colour images, the first plane in the third dimension represents the red pixel intensities, the second plane represents the green pixel intensities, and the third plane represents the blue pixel intensities. Each pixel value is between 0 and 255 which represents the intensity of each colour pixel
I will find closest KNN member in this project.
